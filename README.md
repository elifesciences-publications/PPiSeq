# PPiSeq

## Code for the analysis of PPiSeq data

### Analyses for Figures 1, 2, 3, 4A-C, 5, and Supplementary Figures S1-13

There is a script for each figure panel (e.g. Figure1A). To run the code, 
please download the addtional datasets 
(Mendeley Data, https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9ygwhk5cs3/2), and change the directory in 
the script accordingly. You can find explanations for some important 
datasets in the Read_me.txt in the corresponding directory. 

### Analyses for Figure 4D-F, 6, and Supplementary Figure S14

To replicate these, or extend the analyses, change into that `subtree` 
directory. Then, consult that `README.md` file for instructions on how to
download the data archive, extract it, and launch the analysis pipeline.
