"DMSO_barcode_count_correction_filter.R" is a home-made R script to make barcode count trajectories, correct the barcode count based on PCR chimeras at each time point, and identify the noisy trajectories and merge them in DMSO environment.

We run similar scripts for other environments and obtain high-confidence barcode count trajectories, which can be used as the input for Fit-seq (https://github.com/sashaflevy/Fit-Seq) to obtain fitness values for double barcodes in different environments.
